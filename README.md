# OSU Room Rate App Source Code

This app was created for the 2025-2026 Winter Term Term-Long GDGC Hackathon. It is basically an app that lets users see classrooms/labs/lecture halls they may have used at OSU and rank their overall experience with them.

The app is accessible on web at https://osurooms.bobjoerules.com and soon will be available on the app and google play stores.

# Notes

- This app uses firebase for the ranking system, submissions, comments, and user accounts.
- All room data has been moved to Firebase as of 26/1/26
